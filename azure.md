# Homework Assignment: Exploring Microsoft Azure

## Storage 
### Azure Data Lake Storage
• A cloud-based enterprise data lake storage solution that can store a large amount of a wide variety of data, in a single location

• This can be a useful storage solution for storing large amounts of data for an institution that will be utilized in Python programming.

### Azure Files
• Fully managed cloud-based and on-premises file sharing service that is accessible through Windows, Linux, macOS platforms

• Azure files can be mounted on virtual machines, enabling easier access to file data with virtual coding. In addition, Azure files can be used to store application data on the cloud while an application continues to run locally.

## Compute
### Azure Virtual Desktop
• A virtual Windows 11 or 10 desktop experience with the ability to configure the environment based on the user, using the Windows Server

• Using the Azure Virtual Desktop, you are able to gain access to Windows-only tools if you are working on a mac. In addition, you are able to set up multiple virtual Desktops, that you can dedicate to unique Python projects without using your own computer.
### Azure App Services

•A fully managed HTTP-based platform as a service used for hosting web applications, APIs and mobile back-ends

•With Azure App Services, you can program in multiple languages (including Python), utilize integrated tools such as Visual Studio Code and Java Tools, and run code snippets without a server. These are all useful tools when programming with Python to simplify the programming experience.
## Database
### Azure SQL Edge

•An optimized relational database engine with built in machine learning and artificial intelligence abilities, data streaming capabilities, meant for IoT devices

•Azure SQL Edge supports data streaming, time-series and provides built in ML capabilities to analyze data from the application coded in Python. Python is used to program IoT devices, so these features would be useful.

### Azure Cosmos DB

• A fully managed, globally distributed, noSQL and relational database offering high speed, open-source APIs and SDKs for multiple programming languages

•This service offers APIs and SDKs, which are useful in Python programming and application development. The large scalability offered by Azure Cosmos DB is beneficial for any applications that handle large amounts of data.
